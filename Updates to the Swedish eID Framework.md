## 1. Introduction

This document contains updates to the current version of the Swedish eID Framework. The current version of the Swedish eID Framework is published on [http://elegnamnden.github.io/technical-framework](http://elegnamnden.github.io/technical-framework/), and comprises of specifications that are listed as “normative references” in chapter [1.1](#normative-references).

The updates presented in this document will be suggested to be part of the next official version of the Swedish eID Framework, and parties are
not required to implement, or support, a suggested update until it is part of a Swedish eID Framework specification. However, Identity Providers are strongly advised to implement the updates in this document that concerns interoperability issues and/or covers a specific functionality that is handled by the Identity Provides.

For each update the following is covered:

-   The reason for the update.

-   The parties that will be affected by the change.

The update document represents changes that are not “substantive”. The changes focus on clarifications to ambiguous or conflicting
specification text, and are intended to reduce interoperability problems within the Swedish eID federation.

In this document, update change instructions are presented with surrounding context as necessary to make the intent clear. Original specification text is often presented as follows, with problem text highlighted in bold:

* "This is an original specification. **This is text that needs to be changed.**"

New specification text is typically presented as follows, with new or changed text highlighted in bold:

* "This is an original specification. **This is the new text that was added in the errata.**"

### E.1. Scoping in Authentication Requests sent by Signature Services

**Updates**: Version 1.4 of the “[Deployment Profile for the Swedish eID Framework](http://elegnamnden.github.io/technical-framework/latest/ELN-0602_-_Deployment_Profile_for_the_Swedish_eID_Framework.html)”

An Identity Provider may adapt user interfaces or authentication procedures to different Service Providers either based on static configuration or based on information found in the Service Provider's metadata. It can therefore be useful for an Identity Provider to know which Service Provider that requested the signature that caused the Signature Service to request authentication in order for the Identity Provider to maintain the same user experience and procedures regardless of whether authentication is requested directly by the Service Provider, or by a Signature Service as a result of a signature request from the same Service Provider. Therefore, section 7.2, "Authentication Requests", of \[EidProfile\] has been extended with the following:

**New**:

**It is RECOMMENDED that the `<saml2p:Scoping>` element containing a `<saml2p:RequesterID>` element holding the entityID of the Service Requestor is included in `<saml2p:AuthnRequest>` messages generated by a Signature Service.**

    <saml2p:Scoping>
      <saml2p:RequesterID>http://www.origsp.com/sp</saml2:RequesterID>
    </saml2p:Scoping>

***Example when the `<saml2p:RequesterID>` element is used to inform the Identity Provider about which Service Provider that requested the signature associated with this request for authentication.***
