## 1. Introduction
Electronic signatures have a limited lifespan where they can be validated and determined to be authentic. Many factors may contribute to make it harder to validate electronic signatures over time such as:

- Trusted information about the validity of the signing certificate is not available
- No proof of time when the signature was actually created
- Algorithms used to create the signature is no longer considered secure
- Services necessary to validate the signature are no longer available
- Inability to verify supporting evidence such as, CA certificates, OCSP responses, revocation lists or time stamps

The challenge to validate an electronic signature is increasing with time to the point where it simply is impossible to verify the actual signature with sufficient level of assurance.

Current existing standards such as the ETSI AdES profiles for CMS, XML and PDF signatures can be used to prolong the lifetime of a signature by storing data that supports validation of the signature beyond the lifetime of the signing certificate. The problem with this approach is that the amount of information that must be stored with the signature is growing over time. The growing amount of information and signed objects that must be validated in order to verify the original signature is growing in complexity to the point where it may become infeasible to validate the original signature.

The signature validation token (SVT) defined in this document takes a fundamentally different approach to the problem by providing an evidence that asserts the validity of a signature. The SVT is issued by a trusted authority and asserts that a particular signature was successfully validated according to defined procedures at a certain time. The basic idea and intent behind the SVT is that once the SVT is issued by a trusted authority, any future validation of that signature is satisfied by validating the SVT without any need to also validate the original signature.

This approach drastically reduces the complexity of signature validation of old signatures for the simple reason that validating the SVT just requires validation of the signature over the SVT. The SVT can be signed with keys and algorithms that makes it valid for a considerable time in the future and the SVT can be re-issued with fresh keys and signature to extend the lifetime of the original signature validity, if necessary.

### 1.1. Requirements Notation

The key words **MUST**, **MUST** **NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL** **NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD** **NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 \[[RFC2119](#rfc2119)\] \[[RFC8174](#rfc8174)\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

These keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify requirements over protocol features and behavior that affect the interoperability and security of implementations. When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their natural-language sense.


<a name="definitions"></a>
### 1.2. Definitions

This document use the following defined terms <sup>1</sup>:

Term | Meaning
--- | ---
Signed Data  | The data covered by a particular signature. This is typically equivalent to the signed document and represents the data that the signer intended to sign. In some cases, such as in some XML signatures, the signed data can be the collection of several data fragments each referenced by the signature. In the case of PDF, this is the data covered by the "ByteRange" parameter in the signature dictionary.
Signed Bytes  | These are the actual bytes of data that was hashed and signed by the signature algorithm. In most cases this is not the actual Signed Data, but a collection of signature metadata that includes references (hash) of the Signed Data as well as information about algorithms and other data bound to a signature. In XML this is the canonicalized SignedInfo element and in CMS/PDF signatures this is the DER encoded SignedAttributes structure.

> \[1\]: When these terms are used in their defined meaning, they appear with a capitalized first letter as shown in the table.

<a name="function"></a>
### 2.1. Function

The function of the Signature Validation Token (SVT) is to capture evidence of signature validity at one instance of secure signature validation process and to use that evidence to eliminate the need to perform any repeated cryptographic validation of the original signature value as well as reliance on any hash values bound to that signature. The SVT achieves this through binding the following information to a specific electronic signature though external evidence:

- Unique identification of the signature
- The data and metadata signed by the signature
- The signer's certificate that was validated as part of signature validation
- The certificate chain that was used to validate the signer's certificate
- Assertion that this signature was validated, when validation was performed, which procedures that was used to validate the signature and the outcome of the validation
- Assertion that evidence of time when the signature is known to have existed was validated, which procedures that was used to validate the time of existence and the outcome of the validation

Using an SVT is equivalent to validating a signed document in a system once and then using that document multiple times without revalidating the signature for each usage. Such procedure is common in systems where the document is residing in a safe and trusted execution environment where it is protected against modification during usage. The SVT simply allows the time and environment where the document can be stored and used to expand beyond a local controlled environment and a short instance of time.

Using the SVT, the signed document can be validated once using a reliable trusted service and then that SVT can be used to extend reliance of that secure validation process. The SVT is therefore not only a valuable tool to extend the lifetime of a signed document, but also a useful tool to deploy and use one secure external validation service instead of having a close integration between signature validation and document usage.

<a name="signature-validation-token-syntax"></a>
### 2.2. Signature Validation Token Syntax
The SVT is carried in a JSON Web Token (JWT) in accordance with \[[RFC7519](#rfc7519)\].

<a name="data-types"></a>
### 2.2.1. Data types
Content of claims in an SVT are specified using the claims data types in the following table:

Claims Data Type |Â JSON Data Type | Description
---|---|---
**String**  | string  | An arbitrary case sensitive string value.
**Base64Binary**  | string  | String representation of Base-64 encoded byte array of binary data.
**StringOrURI**  | string  | As defined in \[[RFC7519](#rfc7519)\]. (A JSON string value, with the additional requirement that while arbitrary string values MAY be used, any value containing a ":" character MUST be a URI).
**URI**  | string  | A valid URI
**Integer**  | number  | A 32 bit signed integer value (from -2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup> - 1).
**Long**  | number  |  A 64 bit signed integer value (from -2<sup>63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup> - 1).
**NumericDate**  |  number |  As defined in \[[RFC7519](#rfc7519)\]. (A JSON numeric value representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time, ignoring leap seconds.)
**Boolean**  | boolean  | The explicit value true or false.
**Object\<Class\>**  | object  | A JSON object holding a claims object of a class defined in this document (see section 2.2.2).
**Map\<Type\>**  | object  | A JSON object with name value pairs where the value is an object of the specified Type in the notation. Example: Map\<String\> according to this notation is a JSON object with name value pairs where all values are of type String.
**Array**  | array  |  An array of values of a specific data type as defined in this table. An array is expressed in this specification by square brackets. E.g. **\[String\]** indicates an array of String values and **\[Object\<DocHash\>\]** indicates an array of DocHash objects.
**Null** | null | Representing an absent value. A claim with a null value is equivalent with an absent claim in this specification.

<a name="signature-validation-token-jwt-claims"></a>

Each profile MUST as a minimum define:

- How to specify reference to Signed Data content of the signed document.
- How to make reference to the target signature and the Signed Bytes of the signature
- How references should be made to certificates supporting the signature
- Whether each signature is supported by it's own SVT, or whether one SVT may support multiple signatures of the same document.
- Explicit information on how to perform signature validation based on an SVT, if applicable.
- How to attach an SVT to a document signature or signed document, if applicable.


<a name="signature-validation-with-signature-validation-token"></a>
## 4. Signature Validation with signature validation token

Signature validation based on an SVT SHALL follow the following basic steps.

1. Locate all available Tokens available for the signed document that is relevant for the target signature.
2. Select the most recent SVT that can be successfully validated and meets the requirement of the relying party
3. Verify the integrity of the signature and the Signed Bytes of the target signature using the `sig_ref` claim.
4. Verify that the SignedData reference in the original signature matches the reference values in the sig_data_ref claim.
5. Verify the integrity of referenced Signed Data using provided hash values in the sig_data_ref claim.
6. Obtain the verified certificates supporting the asserted signature validation through the signer_cert_ref claim.
7. Verify that signature validation policy results satisfies the requirements of the relying party.
8. Verify that verified time results satisfies the context within which the signed document is used.

After validating these steps, signature validity is established as well as the trusted signer certificate binding the identity of the signer to the signature.
